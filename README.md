# PentestMonkey

A simple cli to help with setting up basic reverse shells and listeners in various languages as part of the pentest process. Mostly wrote this to help with CTFs . 
Cli is written in bash script. The intent was to put all the tools needed to perform various aspects of pentesting into one place.  

It should go without saying that you need to have the tools and languages installed for the various reverse shell payloads and listeners, and should probably have this
running on a linux terminal of some sort with gnome-terminal 

future additions will hopefully include tools for other parts of the pentesting process 
port scanning, directory fuzzers, crawlers/spiders, brute force tools, various methods of privilege escalation etc.
